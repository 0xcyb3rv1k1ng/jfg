JFG

JFG is a simple web application that allows users to track their Ethereum balance over time using their wallet address. The application uses the Etherscan API to fetch transaction data and displays it on a line chart.

Installation
  Clone this repository to your local machine.
  Open the index.html file in your web browser.

Usage
1. Enter an Ethereum wallet address in the input field.
2. Click the "Submit" button to retrieve the wallet balance history.
3. The chart will display the Ethereum balance for the wallet over time.

  The x-axis represents the date and the y-axis represents the balance in Ether (ETH).
  Hovering over the line on the chart will display the balance at a specific point in time.

Contributions
We welcome contributions to JFG! Here are some ideas for features or improvements that could be added:

  Additional time intervals for the chart: Currently, the chart displays the user's Ethereum balance over time with monthly intervals. It would be great to add options     for daily or weekly intervals as well.

  Support for other tokens: Currently, JFG only tracks the user's Ethereum balance. It would be great to add support for other popular ERC-20 tokens, such as USDC or       DAI.

  Display balance in dollar values: It would be great to add an additional chart that displays the user's Ethereum balance in dollar values. This could be done by          fetching the current price of Ethereum from a cryptocurrency price API.

If you would like to contribute to JFG, please feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. We look forward to seeing your contributions!
